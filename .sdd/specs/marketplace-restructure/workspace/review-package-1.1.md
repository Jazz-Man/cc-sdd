# Review Package — Task 1.1, Round 1

- Task: 1.1 (bean cc-sdd-594v) — Execute the payload move as a handed user-run batch
- Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (per the task bean's _Requirements_ line)
- Scope: the design's payload move set — skills/, assets/, bin/, hooks/, README.md, docs/guides/, .claude-plugin/plugin.json — from repo root into plugins/sdd/
- Baseline note: working tree was clean pre-task; the task bean's Report/Notes appends were committed by the user in a separate commit BEFORE the batch (per the design precondition); the batch ran as user-executed `git mv` — no agent git writes
- Staged state: 55 entries, ALL R100 (pure renames, zero content hunks); `git status --porcelain` shows no M/A/D/?? outside the rename set; plugins/sdd inventory: .claude-plugin/ (plugin.json 208B), skills/, assets/, bin/, hooks/, docs/guides/, README.md
- Delta for adjudication: the implementer's read-only sweep reported "56 tracked payload files"; the staged rename count is 55; the repo root carries zero payload residue (remaining at root: docs/superpowers/, plugins/, tmp/, CLAUDE.md, LICENSE, hidden working-state dirs, marketplace.json). Verify against the design's payload inventory and rule the delta expected (e.g., the staying marketplace.json swept into the count) or a finding.
- Post-move inspections (fresh, orchestrator-run): rename purity PASS (0 non-R100); old-path history present (`git log` reaches pre-move commits on skills/impl/SKILL.md at ac70379 and .claude-plugin/plugin.json at 245e547); `claude plugin validate .` intentionally NOT run — it is task 1.2's gate, not this task's
- RED_EVIDENCE: N/A — structural move task, no behavioral code
