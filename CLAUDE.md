# sdd — Kiro-style Spec-Driven Development (Claude Code plugin)

This repository is a local Claude Code plugin marketplace; the sdd plugin lives
at `plugins/sdd/` (the main plugin) alongside `plugins/biome-lsp/` (a
language-server plugin wiring biome for JS/TS/JSON/CSS). The sdd plugin ships prompt-only
skills for spec-driven development (discovery → requirements → design → tasks →
implementation → validation) with subagent-first execution. Skills are invoked as `/sdd:<name>`; skill texts resolve
shared files via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. There is no installer and no runtime data
directory created in user projects — specs live under `.sdd/` in whatever project
the plugin is used on.

This file is development context for THIS repository, not user documentation.

Skill texts reference assets as `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/rules/...` and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/templates/...`. In-skill prompt templates used by the
impl orchestrator live beside its `SKILL.md` under
`plugins/sdd/skills/impl/templates/`.

## Editing rules

- The user reviews, tests, and commits at each stop point (spec §5.4).
- Skills may NOT flip task checkboxes or write progress/approval state — beans
  is the only tracker (spec §6).
- Do not duplicate the global beans guide in skill texts; one-line references only.
- No double-brace placeholders anywhere — templates are instruction-style
  documents the fork skills fill by writing content.

## Verification

- `claude plugin validate .` must pass. With `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  present it validates the marketplace manifest and passes clean — the old
  "missing `author`" accepted-warning is gone (the field exists; the marketplace
  manifest also changes what validate reports on). This root `CLAUDE.md` still
  does not load as plugin context.
- Invariant greps (must return zero hits; scope `plugins/sdd/skills/
  plugins/sdd/assets/ plugins/sdd/hooks/ plugins/sdd/README.md CLAUDE.md
  plugins/sdd/docs/guides/`, plus `plugins/sdd/bin/` for the convention set):
  unresolved double-brace placeholders, the old Kiro settings-directory
  convention, and old skill names carrying the Kiro prefix. Exact patterns and
  the full battery (checkbox-flip, git-write, beans-duplication, and the
  Revisions 4-7 convention invariants: zero plan-document/notes-file
  references, NO_GO spelling, six forks, 15-skill census) are in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-sdd-plugin-conversion-design.md` §10.
- Twin checks (Revision 9, scope `plugins/sdd/skills/`): the GP-1
  fork-resolution and RS-1 FORK-identity count-greps each return exactly 6 —
  one hit per fork file; the spec-requirements/spec-design approve-gate twin
  blocks (`plugins/sdd/skills/spec-requirements/SKILL.md` and
  `plugins/sdd/skills/spec-design/SKILL.md`) are slot-substitution-identical
  (diff empty after the four-slot normalization); deleted delegation sentences
  return zero hits; the 15-skill census over `plugins/sdd/skills/` returns
  exactly 15. The working patterns and paired-diff method are pinned in the
  §4 erratum of
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-content-normalization-design.md`.
- The pattern texts pinned in the two historical design documents above apply
  with the `plugins/sdd/` prefix; those documents are append-only records and
  are not edited.
- e2e dry run per the re-pointed runbook.
- After content changes to skills or assets, re-run the greps and
  `claude plugin validate .` before claiming done.

## Development workflow (this repo)

- Work is tracked in beans (`.beans/`); before starting, check for an existing
  bean, otherwise create one and keep its checklist current. Commit messages
  include the bean file changes alongside code.
- The human reviews and commits.
- The conversion spec and task plan live in `docs/superpowers/`; task briefs and
  reports live in `.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-22-sdd-plugin-conversion/`.
