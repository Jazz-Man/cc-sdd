# sdd — Kiro-style spec-driven development for Claude Code

`sdd` is a prompt-only Claude Code plugin. It runs a spec-driven workflow —
discovery, requirements, design, task plan, implementation — where every skill is
invoked as `/sdd:<name>` and all heavy execution happens in subagents, so the main
conversation stays a place for decisions rather than file dumps.

It borrows the document discipline from Kiro's spec methodology (EARS-format
requirements, design docs with mermaid diagrams, boundary-annotated task briefs)
and the execution discipline from subagent-driven development (fresh implementer
and reviewer per task, status contracts, bounded fix and debug loops, hard stops
where a human must decide).

Honest scope: this is a personal plugin, written for one user's daily workflow.
It is English-only, loaded locally via `--plugin-dir`, and not published to any
marketplace. If it works for someone else, good; it makes no claim of general
support.

## Getting started

From the plugin checkout:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/cc-sdd
```

Inside a running session, `/reload-plugins` picks up edits to skill texts. Run
`claude plugin validate .` in the checkout to confirm the plugin is well-formed.

Skills appear as `/sdd:<name>` (for example `/sdd:discovery`). On session start,
a hook injects the workflow map so the session knows the phase flow and the hard
rules without loading any skill body — see [Bootstrap](#bootstrap).

## The workflow

One command per phase, each ending in a confirm gate before the next. The user
drives the cycle; there is no chain skill that runs everything in one go.

```
/sdd:discovery → /sdd:spec-init → /sdd:spec-requirements → /sdd:spec-design → /sdd:spec-tasks → /sdd:impl
```

- **discovery** researches the idea against the codebase, the workstream brief,
  and beans state, then routes it: extend an existing spec, no spec needed
  (answered directly in chat), one new feature, or a sequential multi-spec
  initiative. Writes `.sdd/brief.md`.
- **spec-init** births the feature: creates `.sdd/specs/<feature>/`, the epic
  bean that the rest of the workflow resolves the feature from, and the three
  phase-gate beans (requirements → design → tasks) that record approvals.
- **spec-requirements** interviews the user one question at a time, then
  dispatches an opus subagent that drafts `requirements.md` in EARS format.
  Approving it auto-dispatches the requirements validator; the phase completes
  only on its GO.
- **spec-design** runs as a fork (fresh subagent): researches the feature and
  writes `design.md` — boundary-first architecture, considered alternatives,
  mermaid diagram. Approval runs the design validator the same way.
- **spec-tasks** runs as a fork: drafts one task bean per sub-task, born
  `draft` — each body's `## Brief` section IS the task brief, there is no
  plan document. The approve gate promotes beans (approve-all or selective)
  to `todo`.
- **impl** executes the approved task beans one at a time (see below),
  stopping after every task.

When a phase ends, its result is presented with a confirm-only question that
also names the next command. Clarifying questions live in discovery and
requirements; design and tasks are review-and-confirm.

Quick one-off work never enters this pipeline — discovery can route it to "no
spec needed" and it happens in the main chat.

## Phase gates

Approval is persistent, not conversational. Each feature epic carries three
phase beans created at feature birth; `completed` on one IS the approval
record. Approving requirements or design auto-dispatches an independent opus
validator first (`validate-requirements` / `validate-design`): GO closes the
phase with a `validated` tag and the document's sha256 recorded in the phase
bean; NO_GO escalates in the four-part format and the phase stays open.
Validators apply only zero-semantics fixes (typos, paths, formatting) and list
every one. Any later gate recomputes the hash — a document edited after its
validation is stale, and stale escalates rather than silently re-validates.
Re-entering an approved phase escalates too: reopen the downstream phases,
accept the desync risk on record, or cancel.

## Single active feature

Exactly one feature is active at any time: the single epic bean with status
`in-progress`. Every skill except `spec-init` and `discovery` resolves the
feature from beans and takes no feature argument. `spec-init` refuses to birth a
new feature while one is in progress (it offers to complete or scrap the current
one first). A follow-up feature discovered mid-work is queued as a `todo` epic
blocked by the active one and starts only after the current feature completes —
or instead of it, if the current one is cancelled.

Multi-spec initiatives follow the same rule: a milestone bean with a strictly
sequential chain of epics. Nothing ever runs in parallel.

## State and artifacts

Two stores, strictly separated — with a size boundary between them:

- **State, verdicts, briefs, and notes live in beans.** Feature = epic bean,
  task = task bean, initiative = milestone bean. Progress, blockers,
  dependencies — all in beans. Nothing ever writes progress, approvals, or
  checkbox flips into documents, and there is no plan document: the task
  beans ARE the plan. Each task-bean body carries the append-only sections
  `## Brief`, `## Report`, `## Notes`, `## Validation`, and `## Parking lot`;
  every machine-parsed verdict line (`- VERDICT: APPROVED`, `- DECISION: GO`,
  …) is written with a lowercase-hyphen mirror tag (`verdict-approved`,
  `decision-go`, …) for cheap cross-bean filtering. Resume means querying
  beans, never re-parsing documents.
- **Blob artifacts live in files**, under `.sdd/` in the target project —
  review packages and other end-to-end-read evidence past roughly 100 lines,
  referenced from beans by pointer:

```
.sdd/
├── brief.md                      workstream narrative (discovery output)
└── specs/<feature>/
    ├── requirements.md           EARS-format requirements
    ├── design.md                 architecture + mermaid
    ├── research.md               validate-gap output, when used
    └── workspace/                append-only blobs: review packages,
                                   qa-digest, design-review and
                                   validation reports, edit digests
```

Three small helpers in the plugin's `bin/` guard the mechanical parts:
`sdd-gate` (impl's three-phase + freshness gate as a read-only script),
`sdd-verdict` (latest verdict token from a bean body), and `sdd-promote`
(the approve gate's `draft` → `todo` promotion — the only write helper).

## Stop-per-task: the user holds git

After every implementation task, `/sdd:impl` stops. The user reviews the diff,
runs what they want to run, and commits. The stop report is deliberately short:
task ID, final status,
review verdict, verification result, and optionally one line of test results.
No diff summaries or file lists — the user watches changes live in the IDE.

Continuing is an explicit choice (via a structured question), as is revising the
task, escalating to a plan change, or aborting the feature.

## Models

Pinned in the skill texts, never the agent's choice:

| Work | Model |
|---|---|
| Requirements, design, and tasks generation | opus |
| All reviews and validations (task review, re-review, whole-branch review, validate-*) | opus |
| Implementation | sonnet |
| Implementation in fix-loop rounds 4–5 and post-debug retries | opus |
| Debugger | opus |

## Interaction rules

- **Every question or choice-point goes through AskUserQuestion.** Detailed
  explanation first in chat prose (approaches, trade-offs), then the structured
  question with the recommended option first and labeled. A plain-text "which do
  you prefer?" ending is not part of the workflow.
- **Subagents never ask the user directly.** They return status contracts
  (`DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT`); the main context
  formulates the question.
- **No blind decisions.** Any concern or deviation from the plan escalates in a
  four-part format:
  1. Per plan: what the plan specified
  2. Actual: what happened
  3. Why it matters: the consequence
  4. Options: accept as-is / fix now / change the plan / abort

  The user decides. Cancellation is a first-class outcome: aborting marks the
  epic and its task beans scrapped, and the branch (created and deleted by the
  user) carries the whole feature away.

## Bootstrap

A SessionStart hook (matcher `startup|clear|compact`) checks whether
`.claude/rules/sdd.md` exists in the target project:

- **Missing** — the plugin's default workflow map is injected as session
  context, wrapped so dispatched subagents ignore it. The session knows the
  phase flow and hard rules without any skill being invoked.
- **Present** — the hook stays silent. The user's file always wins, even if it
  lags behind a newer plugin version. Precedence is by design.

`/sdd:init` writes that file once, from the plugin default. If it already
exists, the skill refuses to overwrite and offers a read-only diff instead.
The hook also runs `beans prime` on session start and before compaction so the
tracker's context survives context compression.

## How it executes

`/sdd:impl` runs inline in the main conversation as an orchestrator. It never
writes code itself — it owns the loop, the beans state, and the user gates, and
dispatches five roles via prompt templates kept in the skill
(`implementer`, `task-reviewer`, `re-review`, `code-reviewer`, `debugger`):

1. Resolve state from beans (every cycle, including after "continue") — active
   feature, the three phase gates (all must be completed and fresh — the
   recorded document hashes must still match), task queue, blocked-by
   relations. Nothing depends on session memory; an interrupted run is
   indistinguishable from a fresh one.
2. Dispatch a sonnet implementer with the task bean id — its `## Brief` body
   section is the brief; no brief file exists — and parse its status contract.
   The implementer appends its own `## Report` (and any `## Notes` one-liners)
   to the bean.
3. Build a scoped review package (working-tree diff vs HEAD; the file stays in
   `workspace/`) and dispatch an opus task-reviewer
   applying the review protocol. Each verdict is recorded on the task bean as
   a `## Validation` line with the package pointer and a mirror tag.
4. **Fix loop, max 5 rounds**: rounds 1–3 resume the same implementer; rounds
   4–5 dispatch a fresh one with the model raised to opus. Each round gets a
   scoped re-review of only the changed files. Minor findings never enter the
   loop — they park in the task bean's `## Parking lot` and surface at feature
   finish.
5. **Blocked path**: a fresh opus debugger (root-cause-first, max 2 rounds).
   Still stuck → the task is marked blocked in beans with the root cause and
   escalated to the user.
6. **Verification gate**: before any completion claim, the validation commands
   are re-run by the orchestrator itself — reported success from the implementer
   is not evidence; only fresh output and exit codes count.
7. **STOP** — short report, concerns in the four-part format, AskUserQuestion.

At feature finish: a whole-branch review (committed diff since the feature
branch diverged from the default branch, plus the uncommitted remainder) and
the `validate-impl` GO/NO_GO gate, sharing a budget of 3 remediation rounds;
both verdicts are recorded on the epic bean's `## Validation`. Learnings from
earlier tasks propagate forward via the completed task beans' `## Notes`
sections.
