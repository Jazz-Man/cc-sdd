User decisions 2026-10-05: (1) helper test suite lives at plugins/sdd/helper-tests.sh; (2) run the full skill-creator validation packaging - evals.json, grading, benchmark, viewer for human review; (3) e2e dry-run deferred by user.

## Summary of Changes

(1) Helper suite persisted at plugins/sdd/helper-tests.sh: self-contained (mktemp sandbox, relative bin path, generalized id extraction, cleanup trap), shellcheck clean, 25/25 from repo location; tech.md verification section now lists it as battery step 3.
(2) Skill-creator packaging: plugins/sdd-workspace (evals.json, iteration-1 with eval-0-plan-task-tree + eval-1-exec-tracking, with_skill vs old_skill=git-fa8d756 snapshot; grading 5/5 vs 2/5 and 4/4 vs 3/4; aggregate benchmark old 57.5% -> new 100%; analyst notes injected; viewer launched for human review).
(3) e2e dry-run deferred by user.
