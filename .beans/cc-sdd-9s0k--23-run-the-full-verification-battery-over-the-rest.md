## Brief

Task: 2.3
Title: Run the full verification battery over the restructured tree

Execute the re-scoped verification battery end to end and confirm every invariant returns its pinned result over the new layout.

- Zero-hit invariant greps over the re-scoped scope: each returns zero hits.
- Twin count-greps: each returns exactly six hits, one per fork file.
- Approve-gate paired-diff over the two spec fork skill files: empty after the slot normalization.
- Skill census over the plugin skills folder: fifteen skills; plugin validation at the root passes with no errors.
- Observable completion: one full battery run reports every pinned result — zero where zero is pinned, exactly six where six is pinned — with no check skipped or re-scoped away.

_Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_
_Boundary: Verification battery_

## Report

Task 2.3 — full verification battery run over the restructured tree (read-only execution; no file edits, no product content touched).

Scope as re-scoped in CLAUDE.md §Verification: main scope `plugins/sdd/skills plugins/sdd/assets plugins/sdd/hooks plugins/sdd/README.md CLAUDE.md plugins/sdd/docs/guides`, plus `plugins/sdd/bin` for the convention set. Tooling per design: `grep -rIn`, `awk`, `sed`, `diff`.

Zero-hit invariant greps — all zero over the re-scoped scope:

- `{{` unresolved double-brace placeholders: 0
- `.kiro` old Kiro settings-directory convention: 0
- `kiro-` old Kiro-prefixed skill names: 0
- checkbox-flip instructions (`- [x]` writes): 0 (incl. bin/)
- spec.json phase/approval writes: 0 (incl. bin/)
- git-write instructions (`git add|commit|push|branch|checkout|switch|rebase|reset|stash|merge`): 0 write instructions; the pattern's only 2 hits are sanctioned read-only `git merge-base` uses in impl/SKILL.md (allowed per Revision 8 / normalization §5)
- plan-document references (`plan.md`): 0; notes-file references (`notes.md`): 0; `tasks.md`: 0; `report.md`: 0
- `brief.md` refs: every hit is the canonical workstream brief `.sdd/brief.md` (discovery-owned, per the workflow map) — zero task-level brief/report file artifacts
- NO_GO spelling: variants (`NO-GO`, `NO GO`) 0; canonical `NO_GO` present (55 hits)
- beans-guide duplication markers (TodoWrite, agentic-first, "--help for full options", beans archive, `--ready`): 0; beans usage in skills is one-line command references, no guide-prose copies
- Deleted delegation sentences over skills/ (templates included): `only git you run` 0; Hard-rule-1 `The user reviews, tests, and commits` 0; `Do not run the next command yourself` 0

Revision 9 twin checks (per the §4 erratum, `grep -rIn`, scope plugins/sdd/skills/):

- GP-1 `asking the main context where the feature lives`: exactly 6 — one per fork file (spec-design, spec-tasks, validate-design, validate-gap, validate-impl, validate-requirements)
- GP-1 `violated; the main context resolves it with the user`: exactly 6 — same six files
- RS-1 `body is your entire task prompt - everything you need is resolved from`: exactly 6 — same six files
- Approve-gate paired-diff: gate blocks extracted from spec-requirements/SKILL.md and spec-design/SKILL.md with the pinned awk (70 lines each); normalized with the four slots in the pinned order (next-command: /sdd:spec-design|/sdd:spec-tasks → token; validator: validate-requirements|validate-design; document: requirements.md|design.md; phase: requirements|design; substituted values normalized, not literal markers); diff EMPTY (exit 0)
- `context: fork` presence: exactly 6, same six fork files

Census and validation:

- 15-skill census over plugins/sdd/skills/: exactly 15 directories, SKILL.md present in all 15
- `claude plugin validate .` at the root: exit 0, "Validation passed"; --json: success true, errors/warnings/notes all empty, target = the root marketplace manifest (per the cc-sdd-qhkg learning, validate names the root manifest but never prints per-entry resolved paths)

Skipped member (the only one): e2e dry run — its runbook is absent from disk, pre-adjudicated and recorded in cc-sdd-9xq7 (the 2.2 report); noted here as the one skipped member with that reason. No other check was skipped or re-scoped away.

Observable completion met: one full battery run; every pinned result returned — zero where zero is pinned, exactly six where six is pinned, census fifteen, validate green.

Concerns: none.

## Notes

• Battery result for validate-impl: full re-scoped battery green end to end (zero-hit greps 0, twins 6/6/6 one-per-fork-file, paired-diff empty, forks 6, census 15, validate exit 0); e2e remains the only skipped member (runbook absent, cc-sdd-9xq7) — requirements 5.1/5.2 evidence complete.

## Validation
- VERDICT: APPROVED - 2026-09-27, review round 1, package: workspace/review-package-2.3.md

## Parking lot
- e2e dry run still open at feature finish - validate-impl must carry the absent-runbook reason (cc-sdd-9xq7 record) into the feature-level GO/NO_GO instead of assuming the member ran.

- STATUS: VERIFIED - 2026-09-27, verification gate (fresh, erratum working patterns): GP-1 twins 6/6, RS-1 twin 6, census 15, double-brace zero-hit 0, claude plugin validate . exit 0

## Summary of Changes
Read-only full-battery run over the restructured tree: 13 zero-hit invariant greps all 0, twins exactly 6 per fork file, approve-gate paired-diff empty, census 15, validate green; sole skipped member e2e (runbook absent, pre-adjudicated) recorded; review round 1 APPROVED (1 MINOR parked).
